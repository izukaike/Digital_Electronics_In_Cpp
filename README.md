# Digital_Logic_In_Cpp
I want to learn more about digital logic and I want to keep up with my C++. Here are my projects! This stemmed from embedded program interview where I got a question to add 2 integers without using the "+" operator and my mind went straight to logical operations and I thought to myself that I could really expand on this project.

Goal:
 - Render a photo on 64-Bit GPU
 - Run a SPI interface on a 64-Bit Pipelined CPU

Skills:
 - C++
 - OOP
 - Software Architecture
 - Digital Electronics/Logic
 - Simulation Development
 - Low-Level C++

ToDo:
 - Optimize Half-Adder
 - Optimize Full-Adder
